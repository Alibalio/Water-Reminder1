# üóëÔ∏è Abandoned Code Storage
This folder is solely for storing unusuable, retired or temporarily-removed code either for later use or **permanent removal and archival**.

## What can I do with this code?
You can simply inspect the code, you can try debugging it and fixing it, and if you feel like it's worthy of being in the bot, you can add it back and submit it for approval as a [pull request](https://github.com/PyBotDevs/water-reminder-bot/pulls).

## What are the criteria for code to be abandoned?
We obviously can't list all the possible criteria for code to get abandoned and end up here, but here are a few:

* The code is unsupported by the client
* The code is due of a rewrite
* The code is unfixable (due to bugs)
* The code is retired (removed from the bot)
* The code is written, but is not ready for use in the bot yet

## Naming format
If you feel like a snippet of code has to be abandoned from the bot, paste the code in a file in this folder. It should have this specific naming format:

`{command names or descriptions}.{code language}.bak`

For example, if I have to move a command named `test()` written in Python to this folder, it will be named:

`test-command.py.bak`

* "test-command" is the command name.
* "py" is the language in which the code is written.
* "bak" is the (general) backup file format.
